Design Document for pong
Student: Stephen Chang Date: April 1 2017

PURPOSE
	The purpose of pong is to let the user play the game 'pong' on a UNIX terminal. 
	The user moves the paddle by pressing keys.

IMPLEMENTATION
	The implemtation is based on the curses library and signal handlers.

The main thread
	● sets up the screen and terminal settings,
	● activates the signal handler, and then
	● waits for user input in an endless loop.
When the user presses the 'k' or 'm' keys, the main thread
	● changes the paddle position and
	● redraws the paddle.
When the user presses the 'q' key (or when all balls are lost and the user presses any key), the main thread
	● deactivates the signal handler and
	● resets the terminal settings.
The signal handler is excuted several times a second in a separate thread and
	● moves and redraws the ball,
	● reverts the direction of the ball if it bounces off a wall or the paddle, and
	● reduces the number of balls left if the ball leaves the court.
When all balls are lost, the signal handler
	● displays a 'game over' message and
	● deactivates the signal handler.
	
Details
The SIGINT handler (Ctrl-C) is disabled because the program 
should reset the terminal settings before it exits.
